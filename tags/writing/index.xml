      <title>Bandwidth of communication</title>
      <link>https://ssaraf.com/bandwidth/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People know how the medium of conversation affects the discussion itself. For example, if you have a high number of back-and-forth messages with someone over Slack, you might suggest a quick video chat to delve more deeply into the issue. More information can be conveyed, faster, with a Zoom conversation. But what if neither party had suggested a video conference? Would we realize we were trapped in surface-level conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not intuitive that the properties of a signal will affect its message, but they do. As different communication mediums emerge, we need to understand the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the terms electrical engineers use do seem to translate over fairly well to human-human communication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bandwidth - how much information can be conveyed in one message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frequency - how often can you convey it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think bandwidth and frequency explain the relationship between email and slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is lower bandwidth than email - while you can write a paragraph in slack, you can write much longer memos over email. But slack is intrinsically much higher frequency. It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to slack someone 10 times a day. For two people who want to communicate normally, slack is preferable to email, because the &amp;ldquo;speed&amp;rdquo; is closer to regular conversation. For memos, where a large amount of communication is sent at once, email is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Slack has high frequency, low bandwidth, and email has low frequency, high bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, you could have any conversation with any tool. Practically, which mechanism you use affects not just how much and how fast you can convey things, but what things you discuss at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One observation I&amp;rsquo;ve had coming out of the pandemic is that meeting up with a coworker in person is a very alien experience! We talk more deeply about the subject at hand, and I have far more &amp;ldquo;a ha&amp;rdquo; moments in person than I ever do over zoom. That seems to imply that there were fewer such moments before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast wasn&amp;rsquo;t as obvious in a world where all interactions had to happen over zoom. But now that in-person is an option, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; discussions convey even more information than Zoom does, faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have more frequent zooms, but the one in-person discussion you have will achieve far more. &lt;strong&gt;In-person discussion, unlike any other communication form, is &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; high frequency and high bandwidth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s bad news for remote workers, whose standard argument is that you can provide the same value from afar as you can in person. The raw math of commuting meant that working remotely &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; more efficient in terms of hours worked. But while that may be true for solitary pursuits, building software often requires a lot of interaction. Those extra hours are a lot less efficient in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we measure bandwidth/frequency of communication in a conversation more directly? I think we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re in a meeting with someone over zoom about a particularly important business problem, but, in the middle of your conversation, their audio gets filled with background noise from nearby construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the likelihood that you continue discussing the problem in-depth? Do you try to explain a more abstract concept that underlies the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the answer is no. I&amp;rsquo;ll more commonly surf to another topic of conversation that can be covered better even with impaired communication. For example, I might talk more if I think the other person can hear me okay, but can&amp;rsquo;t speak as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like the old way of getting out of a phone conversation. You grab a candy wrapper and crinkle it next to the mouthpiece&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;oh it&amp;rsquo;s hard to hear you so I&amp;rsquo;ll call you later&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about frequency? Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re meeting regularly with a team that works 10 timezones away. You&amp;rsquo;re constrained in &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you can talk to the team because the working hours hardly overlap. Thus you reduce the number of meetings you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framed this way, communication issues show up everywhere. How about that meeting where 10 people have their video on and 1 random guy has called in via phone? I guarantee rando isn&amp;rsquo;t speaking nearly as much in the forthcoming discussion. What about a 5 person meeting in a room, with one person over zoom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger with different communication protocols isn&amp;rsquo;t about the &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of the communication, it&amp;rsquo;s about whether certain topics are discussed in-depth at all. If there&amp;rsquo;s some deep insight to be gleaned, it seems like it can only be gleaned in a relaxed, shared, in-person atmosphere, with time for (at least) two people to think. I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to ever get that over zoom or slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who only work remotely might be just as capable, but they might be trapped in the shallow end of the pool. When everyone was in the shallow end, no one knew the difference, but as we return to in-office work, the gap will be magnified. Maybe most worryingly, coworkers won&amp;rsquo;t know to blame the communication medium - they&amp;rsquo;ll instead assume incompetence or lack of context or any of the other usual talking points. It&amp;rsquo;ll seem coincidental that the people in the office &amp;ldquo;seem to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on&amp;rdquo; and the people on the outside &amp;ldquo;seem out of touch&amp;rdquo;. And what&amp;rsquo;s worse, those assessments might be true, in the sense that the in-office person is more likely to generate unique insights than the remote worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a good solution to this problem? I wonder if some of the newer tech, where users are in the same &amp;ldquo;virtual room&amp;rdquo; for long periods, would allow the sort of depth that is achievable so easily at the water cooler. Until then, it may be prudent to consider lower bandwidth communication as a kind of handicap - and defer deep conversations to the next high bandwidth opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crypto in the cave</title>
      <link>https://ssaraf.com/crypto_in_the_cave/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ssaraf.com/crypto_in_the_cave/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crypto seems to be a great divider amongst my friends and colleagues. Some think of it as the next step in human innovation, the future of finance, a political and social movement, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, including myself, see it as a horrible mixture of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/ponzi.html&#34;&gt;Ponzi scheme&lt;/a&gt;, MLM campaign, and suicide cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to provide much utility over existing solutions - no software engineer chooses a ledger over, say, a database. You will have a hard time finding a company &amp;ldquo;built on crypto&amp;rdquo; that is not in some way also selling crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a financial perspective, it seems to be a way of avoiding  regulation (and is thus a great place to take old financial tactics like wash trading and re-use them on a new generation of fools). Since bitcoin and its ilk don&amp;rsquo;t represent economic activity like stocks / bonds, it seems that its only intrinsic value is to sell it to someone who thinks they can sell it for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks compare investing in crypto to investing in gold. But I think investing in gold is stupid too - it only makes sense as a hedge against other trades. Crypto is correlated with the market, but more volatile, so would make a bad hedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing crypto seems to do well is enrich a small group of people who created whatever token / NFT thing is popular, and a larger group of VCs and tech companies &amp;ldquo;selling shovels&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, gold, like stocks and everything else at the moment, trades far above intrinsic value. Why not have a meme token that trades for more than the market caps of half the S&amp;amp;P?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, while I think crypto is stupid, I could be wrong. My point isn&amp;rsquo;t about crypto specifically, but about why my friends disagree about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People I know used to segment the way you&amp;rsquo;d expect if you were a political reporter in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was the city dwelling, tech / finance / law / medicine working, IPA-drinking, educated crowd. They&amp;rsquo;d invite people to dinner parties with multiple appetizers. They only vaguely cared about sports. They voted for Democrats until they get rich, after which they became libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the &amp;ldquo;flyover country&amp;rdquo; dwelling, blue collar job working, gun wielding, street smart crowd. They&amp;rsquo;d have kids early. They&amp;rsquo;d have barbeques and watch football. They voted for Republicans as a rule but only vaguely cared about politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more thoughts on these two groups, see this &lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/&#34;&gt;excellent piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the above seem incredibly old fashioned? The first is now a &amp;ldquo;woke mob&amp;rdquo; who will very carefully eat &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; food and have strong opinions about gender identification on your Zoom username, and the second proudly wears MAGA hats but not face masks and has strong opinions about post-op trans women using female bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was just about political polarization, that would be one thing. But now the reality distortion field of the most recent elections seem to have rubbed off on everything else. Crypto is the latest example of many in which the questions are crazy, and up is down, and black is white. In fact, conversations about almost anything are nerve-wracking - even writing the above makes me worry about either being cancelled or summoning some type of red-hat mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the worst thing is that, generally speaking, I don&amp;rsquo;t care about most of it. I agree that much of it is important to other people. But not to me, except in the vague sense of wanting to talk about something other than the weather - these subjects come up most often in conversation. I feel guilty about not caring enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For topics that I do care about, I see a streak of subjective, anecdotal, vague thinking which is worrisome, since it seems to be coming from all angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my very left-leaning city, many (if not all) restaurants will have an indoor &amp;ldquo;mask on&amp;rdquo; policy. Aerosolized viruses transmit just fine while you&amp;rsquo;re eating - putting the mask on while talking but taking it off to eat food is stupid. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to take the mask off to eat, keep it off. Or don&amp;rsquo;t serve food indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the current administration&amp;rsquo;s tactics around school closures, giving vaccines to children, etc have erred irrational. This leads parents to do well-justified things like smuggle their 11 and 4 year old kids to get the vaccine earlier than they &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right, there&amp;rsquo;s too many examples to name. Perhaps the proud anti-vax and anti-mask groups are the easiest to pick on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of the allegory of the cave. We&amp;rsquo;re all seeing shadows on the wall, and nobody knows what&amp;rsquo;s real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to find out the truth about crypto, where would you go? Who would you ask? If you wanted to find the truth about vaccine effectiveness, where would you read it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem is that no one knows. There is no authority that can be trusted to give accurate, practical answers to these questions. The CDC, the standard authority, will give accurate but not risk-adjusted recommendations. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-07-27/timeline-cdc-mask-guidance-during-covid-19-pandemic&#34;&gt;early in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;  they were wrong about the utility of masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zeynep&#34;&gt;prominent folks&lt;/a&gt; will give closer to optimal recommendations, but their voices are diluted along with all the other loud people, and the reason they have a voice is, forgive me, they&amp;rsquo;re good at social media. Do we really think that the best authority on any subject is the one that emerges from the cauldron there? Or are we just picking the top dog in a mangy pack? For every Zeynep there is a Joe Rogan, and we can&amp;rsquo;t ignore that they emerged in the last few years in roughly the same way. How do we know which is which?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to &amp;ldquo;study the science&amp;rdquo; either. You can read &lt;a href=&#34;https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about a detailed meta-analysis on ivermectin, with the conclusion that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; help patients with COVID, so long as they&amp;rsquo;re in a country where the populace has worms and therefore a dewormer helps improve clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point isn&amp;rsquo;t the specific conclusion but the type of analysis that&amp;rsquo;s needed to interpret even a &lt;strong&gt;meta analysis&lt;/strong&gt; of scientific studies on a subject of immense practical value to all of humanity for the last two years. No one could possibly have the time to do the &amp;ldquo;from first principles&amp;rdquo; analytical approach in every area, so you have to read some one else&amp;rsquo;s summary, and right there you&amp;rsquo;re depending on that person&amp;rsquo;s credibility and platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before now, credibility and platform were determined by a small group of elite institutions, on both the left and right. The WSJ and NYT would &lt;em&gt;retract incorrect pieces&lt;/em&gt; if they were found to be misleading in even the smallest way. Scientific studies were published in prominent journals, and you would suffer professional consequences if you put something inaccurate in a paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who succeeded at those institutions were academically or professionally qualified, so you could trust what you read. And while those organizations still exist in today&amp;rsquo;s discourse, it feels like they&amp;rsquo;re drowned out from the mass of loud voices on more &amp;ldquo;decentralized&amp;rdquo; platforms like Twitter, Substack, Youtube, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one issues a &amp;ldquo;retraction&amp;rdquo; on Twitter, unless the mob comes after them. And even in those circumstances, the person recanting isn&amp;rsquo;t doing so because of what&amp;rsquo;s factually accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so rather than accuracy or truth we go for who can say the most interesting things, or the funniest jokes, or who can build an audience, which are different sorts of skill sets. You can&amp;rsquo;t even find the humble truth-seekers because these platforms only throw popular people at you to follow, not those poor shmucks tweeting to &amp;lt;100 friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s in that world where people are making new digital currencies and the mob is buying them up and they go up in value and more people join the mob to get in on the action, and soon you have an NFT of a picture of Elon Musk worth more money than can even be conceived of, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything except reflect its own ever-increasing demand and fixed supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto can go to the moon, for all I care. I wish those people well. But I want a place to read about it that will put facts above whatever religion they&amp;rsquo;ve adopted. I worry that I have my own blind spots - things that I believe that aren&amp;rsquo;t really true, but I&amp;rsquo;m in a weird self-reinforcing bubble that makes me believe them stronger and stronger. And I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a personal brand</title>
      <link>https://ssaraf.com/building_a_personal_brand/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ssaraf.com/building_a_personal_brand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One logistical update - I&amp;rsquo;ve centralized the posts that would usually go to the sudopoint or SQL blog to this one. If you were subscribed to sudopoint or on my SQL class mailing list, you&amp;rsquo;re now subscribed here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to see many of my friends starting to build public online presences. Previously they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to want to. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason seems to be that many of them are starting companies, and CEOs often have to do a lot of marketing. Without a pre-existing marketing machine, they try to bootstrap one from their personal social accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it&amp;rsquo;s more than that, and I think there&amp;rsquo;s a link to some of the earlier thoughts on this blog related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ssaraf.com/keynesian_workweek&#34;&gt;work week&lt;/a&gt;, and building &lt;a href=&#34;https://ssaraf.com/side_projects&#34;&gt;side projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are each our own little company now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That converts &amp;ldquo;full time employment&amp;rdquo; into something that looks a lot more like one larger company subcontracting work to a smaller company (You Inc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also explains why employers increasingly are looking to reduce global benefits in favor of those that the individual employee can decide how to wrangle. Instead of insurance benefits, pay enough salary that employees can buy on the exchange. Instead of dumbbells in the office, a stipend for doing whatever workouts you want. Instead of 8 hours a day each day, spend however much time you need to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also explains why &lt;em&gt;getting&lt;/em&gt; a job is such a weird experience. Almost no one who gets a job gets it by applying for it via a website. Instead it&amp;rsquo;s about relationships you&amp;rsquo;ve built - effectively, how well you can market yourself as the best subcontractor for the position. Sure, the company doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;call you&lt;/em&gt; a contractor, but you can end the contract tomorrow and go start another one, just like a contractor can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gig economy workers already knew about all of this, of course. But this emerging independence has usually been painted as primarily an advantage to employers, who get away with providing fewer perks to a captive employment base. I think the opposite - this is an advantage, though largely unexploited, for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there&amp;rsquo;s a large &lt;a href=&#34;https://overemployed.com/&#34;&gt;community of people&lt;/a&gt; that now work two &amp;ldquo;full time&amp;rdquo; jobs. For those of us just working the one, we know that it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly possible (in fact, likely) that you only get 10 or 20 hours of productive work in for an employer per week. For highly circumscribed roles, with concrete independent deliverables (i.e. non management), getting multiple jobs is a brilliant approach to maximize your income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, successful companies are getting smaller. And not just startups - I mean regular companies can be built &amp;ldquo;off the shelf&amp;rdquo; and so simply require fewer personnel to get a product to market. The rise of the Indie Hacker movement has been astronomical, and I think will only continue to swell. Journalists are leaving newspapers to start substacks, where they can earn money directly, on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the maximally employable people will be those that take advantage of this structure to market themselves effectively. The main problem is that most of the people I know doing this are, bluntly, super boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasonally peruse twitter, and even the &amp;ldquo;intelligent tech&amp;rdquo; people are primarily posting what I would consider to be absolute drivel. Epigrams that would drive Confucius crazy. Statements that seem controversial but are really just paper thin assessments of the obvious. They are effectively text-only rorschach images meant to get forwarded around as simply the next version of chain letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these posters are pretty thoughtful people, many of whom are brilliant writers. But they need to use twitter / linkedin / facebook as sort of a marketing mechanism to catch a little bit of attention from the vast sea of internet fish. Which they then funnel into whatever scheme they&amp;rsquo;re peddling - youtube channels, substack subscriptions, try my startup, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog isn&amp;rsquo;t an exception, but I can at least be honest about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I think it has implications for those of you reading who don&amp;rsquo;t already have an online presence. All signs point to you being at a disadvantage compared to those who have shamelessly sleazed themselves out on social media. Probably not in your current role, but certainly when looking for a new one, or starting a project that requires a global audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the people who I most respect in my past workplaces, who are often the wisest, most thoughtful people, they often have no meaningful online persona. They don&amp;rsquo;t link to tweets. They barely watch youtube. As far as I can tell, many of them don&amp;rsquo;t even have linkedin profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes me think that as loud and obnoxious as the current online discourse is, the vast majority of people in real life are not writing online at all, and most (especially the most talented and experienced) are barely reading it. They know it&amp;rsquo;s mostly crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is still early in the game. I wonder if participating in it will actually be an advantage, or instead an indicator of which people clumsily jumped into a fad that will eventually fade.&lt;/p&gt;
