          <p>Over the past couple months I&rsquo;ve been declaring all of my side projects to my current employer. It&rsquo;s been a very interesting experience, because, strictly speaking, I don&rsquo;t work for them as an engineer.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky has written an interesting <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/developers-side-projects/">note about side projects</a>. His main thesis is that, from a legal perspective, employers have to <em>try</em> to own all inventions by engineers, to protect themselves when they seek future liquidity (say, in an IPO or major investment round). Folks in management or strategy roles don&rsquo;t usually sign such agreements because they aren&rsquo;t seen as creators of company intellectual property, and I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So why ask permission? Mainly because I want a nice document in writing saying that they&rsquo;re okay with me working on the side, and exactly what criteria I have to abide by in order to continue doing so (I can&rsquo;t hire colleagues to work with me, for instance). I would not even consider using such a document in court - even when I&rsquo;m legally in the clear, my ability to prevail against a large company is effectively nil. It&rsquo;s mostly because, so long as the executives who I checked in with remain at the company, it&rsquo;ll be clear that the decision to let me do this was on them. If something changes, say one of my projects becomes dramatically successful and they would like a percentage&hellip;the same executives would have to judge themselves as bad decision makers. In my experience this never happens, especially when the decision is in writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now completed my first side project. Check it out <a href="https://www.solovine.com/">here</a>. It follows on the heels of my note about creating a modern, software version of the <a href="https://ssaraf.com/a-modern-olympia-academy.html">Olympia Academy</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I noticed when building this. First of all, as a diligent reader of this blog might also have observed, I wrote a lot more. There&rsquo;s something about being in the process of doing something that unlocks creativity in other realms. I&rsquo;d like to explore this more in a future essay.</p>
<p>Second of all, my day job was affected, but not in the way you&rsquo;d think. In terms of raw output, I was more productive. In some ways I suffer from a form of perfectionism; if I&rsquo;m not sure the outcome is going to be good, I&rsquo;d rather procrastinate on delivering the outcome at all. 99% of the time this is a bad thing - executing is usually the best way to get something to perfection, rather than just thinking about it. Because I had limited time each day to work on my side project, I would move as fast as possible to go from idea to working code. And somehow, since I was in that mode, I would stay in that mode at my actual job - I delegated faster to members of my team, and for the items I was individually responsible for, I got it done, <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>So maybe this side project gig has positive externalities outside of its intrinsic value. That would be nice, since I have no idea at all if it even has intrinsic value - I&rsquo;ve built a working v0 and found that unsurprisingly, no one cares about it yet.</p>
